# VEXXX Changelog

---

## v1.5 — 2026-08-16

**Highlights:** APIHub grows from one network into a five-site platform (EvilAngel, Adult Time, TeamSkeet, NewSensations, DFXtra) with browser-driven sign-in, persistent Chrome profiles, and silent per-network session keepalive replacing manual cookie pasting; a full "Add to library" download pipeline with stash-box-first metadata enrichment, native provider-timestamp markers, banner caching, portable-manifest relinking, and Discord batch notifications; Vexxx TV (the IPTV subsystem) built out from a bare scheduling core into a real Xtream Codes panel API so TiviMate can browse live channels and Adult Time's movies as series; a ffmpeg-free GPU generation pipeline (nativegen) for sprites/previews/markers/phash, tuned across three follow-up passes to beat ffmpeg by 2–38x while staying bit-exact; explicit gallery cover images; VR controller-lock so hand tracking stops fighting a connected controller; and a fix for UI text going illegible on any client whose OS preference resolves to a light color scheme.

### feat(iptv, apihub): add DFXtra as a third Gamma-platform network (edff17ffe)

DFXtra (Dogfart Network's 2026 rebrand) turns out to be a third site on the same Gamma platform as EvilAngel and Adult Time — same Algolia app id, same `window.env` shape, scoped by `segment:dfxtra`, same member API and CDN. Its own catalog is small (291 scenes) but its segment isn't: partner-site channels sharing the membership add ~6,900 scenes across 39 series. `apihub_dfxtra_catalog.go` and `routes_iptv_dfxtra.go` mirror the EvilAngel implementation (network-wide channel discovery, `serie_name` as the real channel axis since `studio_name` is useless — every hit reports "DFXtra"); wired into the proxy whitelist, connect targets, and the Gamma keepalive scheduler alongside its siblings.

### fix(ui): give the theme an explicit light color scheme so it can't diverge from dark (cd754c344)

Reported as all UI text rendering black on a dark background — reproducible only with DevTools forcing `prefers-color-scheme` to light. `theme.ts` registered a `colorSchemes.dark` (from the earlier MUI `cssVariables` migration) but no `light`; on a client whose OS preference resolves light, every `Typography` without a hardcoded color fell back to MUI's stock light-theme near-black text, composited over this app's unconditionally-dark background. Fixed by extracting the palette into `appPalette` and registering it identically under both `dark` and `light` — the app never intended to look different in either mode, so making both the same removes the undefined branch instead of patching around it. This is also why it was never caught in dev/CI: those environments default to a dark OS preference almost universally.

### perf/fix(nativegen): amortize marker session setup, then bound its concurrency and memory (598d028cc, 430628f02)

Native marker generation initially lost to ffmpeg outright (13.7s vs 6.0s) — not because GPU decode/encode is slower, but because AMF context setup and full sample-table parsing were being paid once per marker instead of once per scene. Encoder context pooling (mirroring the existing decoder pool, ~10x faster per acquire), scene-wide file reuse, and batched screenshot decoding took a 75-marker scene from ~14.9s/marker to 2.37s/marker; bounding marker concurrency to what the device pools actually hold took it to 1.00s/marker — beating ffmpeg's ~7.4s/marker baseline by ~7x.

A follow-up pass running real generation across several scenes (rather than one) caught two problems the single-scene measurement couldn't see. The batched screenshot decode held every marker's frame as uncompressed RGBA simultaneously until the whole scene finished, spiking system RAM to a ~17.8GB high-water mark on a high-resolution file with many markers; chunked into batches of 16 to cap the peak regardless of scene size. And marker concurrency was a flat 4 against pools of 2, so half of every four concurrent markers paid full unpooled context churn for the whole batch; concurrency is now derived from the pool size via a new exported `nativegen.DevicePoolSize()` instead of a hand-picked constant.

### feat(apihub): native provider markers + Discord batch notifications (db171aecf, 17b9e1dcf)

Adult Time's `action_tags` and some Aylo releases' `timeTags` carry native position markers alongside the catalog metadata; the download pipeline now turns each into a Stash scene marker (primary-tagged by its own label, matched case-insensitively or created) after the scene lands, skipping timestamps a scene already has so re-downloads/relinks don't duplicate. Separately, a user-configured Discord webhook now gets a color-coded summary embed at the end of every download batch (per-scene success/partial/failed + counts); a `/apihub-download/test-webhook` route lets Settings verify a URL before saving. Both are non-fatal — a bad marker source or an unreachable webhook only logs a warning.

### feat(iptv): Xtream Codes panel API for TiviMate — live channels and Adult Time movies as series (a82213bac, 34c01f4c0)

TiviMate's Series tab needs the real Xtream panel API (posters, click-through episode lists) — plain M3U can't do it. Adult Time's movies are multi-scene collections with no single playable file, so each movie maps to a series and each scene to an episode. New `player_api.php` + `/series/{user}/{pass}/{id}` routes reuse the existing Gamma catalog/stream plumbing untouched by the linear 24/7 channel system. Live channels were then consolidated onto the same login: `get_live_categories`/`get_live_streams` reshape the existing channel list, and `/xmltv.php` answers with the same guide the M3U path already generates — replacing a 404 TiviMate had been hitting for every Xtream playlist. Fixed along the way: TiviMate reconstructs live stream URLs from the numeric `stream_id` rather than trusting `direct_source`, which a channel key like `aylo-bangbros-115261` needs a real route for. The `/iptv` mount and Xtream routes now share one `iptvRoutes` instance, so there's a single background catalog warm instead of two independent ones.

### feat(apihub): banner caching + portable-manifest relink job (02a156dd7)

`apihubRelinkJob` restores what a moved library or a fresh install can't otherwise recover: it walks every library path for `apihub.json` manifests written by past downloads (see [[project_apihub_portable_manifest]]) and, for any scene/gallery a normal scan has already (re)created, stamps StashIDs and the source URL back on and re-links the gallery — no network calls, matching scoped to what's already on disk. `apihub_banner_cache.go` adds server-side caching for studio/performer banner images fetched during enrichment, and `apihub_download_metadata.go` centralizes the manifest read/write path both the relink job and the original download job now share.

### feat(iptv/apihub): NewSensations as a push-based scraped network (d0335720a, 1bb1a506e, 04ee85cac, d37bff890, 0df27f7e0)

NewSensations has no JSON API — server-rendered HTML behind a member-cookie gate — so it can't participate in the IPTV system the way the Algolia/REST networks do. Instead an external Go scraper (`apihub_newsensations_scraper.go`) enumerates series/scenes and pushes them into a SQLite sidecar (`newsensations_catalog.db`, WAL, matching the TeamSkeet durations store's pattern); the IPTV provider (`routes_iptv_newsensations.go`) reads exclusively from that store, with an `iptvNetPreparer` implementation reporting warming/incomplete state so partial schedules air instead of failing outright. Stream URLs are pre-signed and expire in ~2 hours, so `ProgramSource()` does a 200ms on-demand refetch at playback time rather than trusting the scraped URL. A later pass added a many-to-many `ns_series_scenes` junction table (scenes appearing across multiple series no longer overwrite `series_id`, with an automatic startup migration to backfill it) and parallelized the series-grid scrape across 16 workers, dropping a 224-series sweep to under 3 seconds. A plugin-directory fallback lets a pre-bundled catalog DB ship with the plugin for a fresh install with no scrape yet run.

### perf(nativegen): skip disposable pictures in the exact-frame run-up; gate phash behind its own switch (297001f79)

Reaching an exact frame means decoding forward from the preceding keyframe, but a picture nothing else predicts from can't affect the target — measured across 17 real files, 50.6% of run-up frames are such pictures. Classified per-codec (H.264's `nal_ref_idc == 0` is an outright signal; HEVC's `_N` unit types are safe to skip only at the top temporal sub-layer, read from the SPS since no file's `hvcC` carries parameter sets) and skipped, verified pixel-identical against the non-skipping walk on 15 real files. Combined with the marker-session work above, a 7680x3840 HEVC phash went from 26.3s to 16.5s (ffmpeg: 38.1s). A companion `concurrency_real_test.go` found no concurrency cliff at all — decode throughput plateaus around 2.5x serial from n=4 out to 16 concurrent 8K sessions — which mooted a planned admission semaphore before it was built ([[project_nativegen_concurrency_negative]]).

Native phash generation was also gated behind its own `nativegen.phash` flag (default **on**, alone among the nativegen switches) rather than running unconditionally whenever the GPU allowed it. It defaults on because a phash's correctness can be stated rather than judged — both backends hash the same frames through the same swscale and come out bit-identical — but the switch exists because a phash is a fingerprint shared with stash-box and other libraries, making it the one asset worth being conservative about. Turning the master `nativegen` switch off now also disables native phash, a behavior change from before this commit.

### feat(nativegen): ffmpeg-free sprite, preview and phash generation via AMF (b7c880b92)

A native GPU generation pipeline that decodes video on an AMD GPU (AMF, cgo-free) and builds sprite sheets, scene previews, marker previews and perceptual hashes without spawning ffmpeg — off by default behind `nativegen.enabled`, and designed to decline any file it can't handle exactly rather than degrade, so ffmpeg stays a true fallback. New packages: a pure-Go ISO-BMFF sample indexer (21/21 exact match against ffprobe up to 96GB, rejects fragmented MP4/MKV outright), the AMF binding itself (device-verified on H.264/HEVC/AV1 up to 8K), and the sprite/preview/frame-extraction/VR-reprojection logic sitting on top. Measured on a 7900 XTX against stash's software-ffmpeg baseline: 38x on an 81-tile 8K sprite sheet, 27–64x on VR reprojection vs `v360`, 2.8x on scene previews, and phash times cut by roughly 3x across resolutions. Held to bit-exactness rather than visual tolerance throughout — 0 bits against the ffmpeg reference on all 8 files checked — because a perceptual hash is only useful if it matches what's computed elsewhere; this required applying both the video and audio track's edit lists (not just video) to avoid a ~37ms A/V skew, and declining files whose edit lists genuinely re-edit content. See [[project_nativegen_pipeline]], [[project_nativegen_mp4_demuxer]], [[project_nativegen_amf_binding]], [[project_nativegen_vr_projection]].

### feat(iptv): Vexxx TV scheduling and network-routing foundation (526375329, 8782106fd, 4e2593921, 60c8a19e0, 21150301a)

The initial buildout of the IPTV subsystem: a cycle-based scheduling core (`schedule.go`) that airs programs on a virtual timeline, a stream-mode/codec-compatibility profile system, and `routes_iptv_network.go` defining the `iptvNetwork` provider contract with cached catalog/program-entry TTLs and exponential-backoff retry on failed fetches. Channels that need warm-up work (a scrape, a token mint) get their own `iptvNetPreparer` interface distinguishing "warming" from "incomplete" so a partially-filled schedule can air instead of failing outright — the seam later NewSensations and TeamSkeet builds on. TeamSkeet gets a persistent duration store to avoid re-fetching runtime data per request; Adult Time's JSON catalog endpoints and interstitial-redirect handling are hardened. See [[project_vexxx_tv_iptv]].

### feat(apihub): download history with CRUD, backed by the first writable sqlite sidecar (0df505635)

`apihub_history.go` adds a persisted, queryable record of every APIHub download batch (per-user choice, not auto-derived from job logs) with create/read/update/delete routes wired into the existing download job and route surface — see [[project_apihub_download_history]] for why this is the first writable sqlite sidecar in the codebase and the design tradeoffs that came with that.

### feat(apihub, stashbox): scene identification prioritizes stash-box, falls back to catalog metadata, and can skip redundant generation (8de9911e7, 185f24935, 3ec2d17a9)

Scene identification during download-import now tries URL-based lookup against the configured stash-box first (new `pkg/stashbox/scene.go` support) and only falls back to the provider's own catalog metadata when stash-box has nothing — canonical data wins where it exists, catalog data fills the gaps rather than being overwritten by it. A new `SkipGenerate` option lets the download pipeline skip sprite/preview/phash generation it knows a subsequent scan will redo, avoiding doubled work on batch imports.

### feat(gallery): explicit cover images independent of the gallery's photo set (f27a19430, 2e36fb79b)

A new `cover_blob` column lets a gallery carry an explicit cover distinct from its contained images — `GetCover`/`HasCover` on the reader, `UpdateCover` on the writer (setting a cover doesn't touch the image count). Wired into both manual gallery creation/editing (`GalleryEditPanel.tsx`, new GraphQL fields) and the APIHub download pipeline, which downloads and links a gallery's cover during import; `ScanZipFile` updated to handle gallery zips carrying their own cover appropriately.

### feat(apihub): TeamSkeet and Adult Time wired in behind persistent-Chrome connect infra; Gamma/Aylo keepalive rebuilt as separate schedulers (97f2fdd21, 7b7dea05f, 36a19f6a8, 8cc7992fe, ca62d4f77)

Adult Time joins as a third proxied/login-gated network — it shares EvilAngel's Gamma CDN but not its account or referrer scoping, so the Algolia referer spoof generalizes from a single blanket rule to a map keyed off the forwarded app-id header. TeamSkeet joins as a fourth, authenticated via a Bearer JWT silently re-minted through the same driven-Chrome refresh flow as Aylo, with `auth.reptyle.com` whitelisted for the OAuth refresh call itself. A shared bug surfaced once both were live: `apihubEntityLink.ts` only special-cased EvilAngel's name-keyed ids, so Adult Time/TeamSkeet performer/tag/studio chips fell through to the numeric-id Aylo branch and crashed the host's `strconv.Atoi` on a name like "Isa Bella" — generalized into a `NAME_BASED_NETWORKS` map covering all three (see [[project_apihub_entity_link_filters]]).

Session keepalive for the two cookie-only networks (EvilAngel, Adult Time) was rebuilt as its own scheduler once it became clear they have no token-refresh endpoint at all — just a ~30-day autologin pair plus a sliding session set the server re-issues via `Set-Cookie` on every authenticated response, which stops rotating the moment nothing forwards the upstream `Set-Cookie` back to the client. TeamSkeet/Aylo's proper refresh-token flows got a parallel dedicated scheduler. See [[project_gamma_shared_catalog]], [[project_apihub_reptyle_refresh]], [[project_apihub_adulttime_network]].

### fix(build): unbreak RC cross-compile pipeline for Go 1.26 (6d4585aa1)

The chromedp bump below raised go.mod's floor to Go 1.26, but the compiler/release Dockerfiles were still pinned to 1.24.3, the release script always pulled upstream's stale compiler image over a local rebuild, the FreeBSD sysroot mirror had gone dead, and linking against the 11.3 macOS SDK failed on a symbol Go's crypto/x509 darwin trampoline now references unconditionally. Fixed all four, patched the missing symbol into the SDK's `Security.tbd`, and dropped the unpublished ARM Linux / macOS arm64 build legs (Apple Silicon runs the Intel build under Rosetta 2 anyway).

### feat(apihub): browser-driven sign-in, persistent Chrome profiles, and the full download pipeline (e66412837, 5207cc4e8, eea7625a0, 513cbc6b9, cafdfc3db, d5d5be1b6)

The foundation this whole release builds on: `/apihub-connect` drives a real, visible Chrome window (chromedp, bumped 0.9.2 → 0.16.0 to stop CDP decode errors against modern Chrome) to a site's actual login page and captures the resulting session cookies once real authentication is detected — replacing manual cookie/token pasting. A per-site Chrome profile persists on disk (session data only, never credentials) so a background headless run can silently re-mint tokens later without a visible window, using "new" headless mode since legacy headless gets fingerprinted and never replays the remember-me session. An always-on 30-minute re-mint scheduler was tried and then deliberately retired in favor of a simpler "sign in again when it lapses" model, with the browser-launch path hardened instead (retry with backoff, clearing stale singleton locks between attempts).

On top of that, a full "Add to library" download pipeline: the plugin resolves direct URLs client-side (keeping tokens in the browser) and posts a batch to the backend, which streams each file as a single sequential JobManager job with live progress in the Tasks table, then imports, phashes, and identifies it. New studios/performers are enriched before creation — provider portraits first, stash-box canonical data filling remaining gaps — touching only entities the library doesn't already have. Bundled: EvilAngel media-proxy whitelisting with per-host referer spoofing, `apihubEntityLink` routing entity-card clicks into the plugin's own grid instead of the host's numeric-id routes, and `PluginApi.libraries.MUI` forwarding the host's `@mui/material` instance (plus an exposed `RatingBanner`) so plugin UIs stop hand-rolling CSS. See [[project_apihub_credential_automation]], [[project_plugin_api_mui_forwarding]].

### feat(VR): controller lock ignores hand tracking when a controller is connected (c49656a34)

Quest sessions were switching to hand tracking on any detected hand motion even with a controller actively in use, fighting the controller's own input. Locks tracking to the controller once one is connected, only falling back to hands after it's actually released.



**Highlights:** Immersive WebXR VR suite — spatial Home lobby with a curved, server-paged scene wall; WebXR Media Layers video path (three.js 0.184); local Bluetooth Handy control bypassing the cloud API; mixed-reality passthrough with in-headset chroma-key; multiple funscripts per scene with in-VR switching; PMVHaven 5th content mode + a flat 2D FapTap browser; in-VR canvas search keyboard; grip-drag repositioning for dome and flat screens; drag-to-scrub and A/B loop marks; controller/hand device models with ray stabilization; MovieFy cover art + manual URL write-back; HeroBanner resilience; watcher auto-identify wiring; plus a deep round of VR jitter, compositor-crash, and passthrough-flicker hardening.

### fix(handy): keep local BLE playback alive across starves, seeks and link drops (d93c71447)

Fixes for local Bluetooth Handy playback that would silently die mid-scene and never recover, plus three bundled VR fixes.

Handy BLE robustness:
- Feeder no longer gives up on the first failed top-up; a watchdog re-polls device state every 750ms so a dropped threshold notification can't leave the buffer to drain unnoticed
- Play/SyncTime ops take a generation ticket and drop themselves if a newer op has arrived, so queued ops can no longer tear down and refeed the stream with stale positions
- Preload only 150 points (enough to start) before `HspPlay` instead of the full 900-point window; background feeder fills the rest — kills seconds of stillness at scene start
- Play position projected forward by BLE setup time so the device doesn't start out behind the video
- `Connect` runs outside the manager mutex and is cancellable, so a disconnect can abort an in-flight 30s scan
- Unexpected link loss auto-relinks with backoff and resumes at the projected position; a deliberate disconnect suppresses it
- Panics in the BLE stack (nil `AdvertisementPayload` on Windows, OS event threads, WS op goroutines) contained rather than taking the server down
- Client tracks the backend's playback *intent* rather than the device's instantaneous HSP state (which dips to paused/starving on every underrun)

Bundled fixes:
- **`fix(vr): replace the Meta system keyboard with an in-scene canvas keyboard`** — the system keyboard hard-crashed the Quest browser on every content tab before a character could be typed. New `VRKeyboardPanel` draws its own keys on an ordinary `VRCanvasPanel`, hit-tested through the same controller-ray pipeline — no DOM focus, no session visibility change, no system overlay. Also gives search to every other WebXR browser
- **`fix(vr): route Home-wall queries only to the active tab's database`** — search/sort/filter now pushed only to the source behind the active tab (Stash DB vs FapTap/PMVHaven sidecars); hidden tabs pick the query up when selected. Sidecar `/counts` endpoints take the same free-text query so chip totals match the grid
- **`feat(pmvhaven): tell the user when a funscript is being generated`** — a `/funscript/status` probe lets the player show "Generating haptics…" / "Analyzing audio…" and report failure instead of hanging. Generation now kicked off on every scene launch (a script belongs to the scene, not a device) so the scrubber heatmap draws for everyone; arming mid-scene is a cache read. Fixes ffmpeg resolution (`exec.ErrDot` on a bare `ffmpeg` resolving to stash's own binary in cwd)
- **`feat(faptap): add a flat 2D browse + player for the FapTap catalog`** — `/faptap` grid + player pages talking to the read-only `/faptap/*` routes, driving the Handy via the shared `InteractiveContext`; navbar entry gated on the sidecar DB being present
- **`fix(vr): don't write playback activity for synthesized sidecar scene ids`** — FapTap/PMVHaven scenes carry namespaced ids (`pmvhaven:…`); `isStashSceneId` now guards the activity write so it isn't sent for content with no Stash row

### feat(handy): drive local BLE playback for all VR content modes (2e6cdaa96)

Complete local (Bluetooth) Handy control for the immersive VR player across every content mode, surviving disconnect/reconnect.

- Funscripts loaded by fetching the scene's funscript URL in the browser and forwarding the JSON to the backend (mirrors the cloud transport). Handles regular scenes, FapTap, PMVHaven and the multi-funscript index uniformly, instead of resolving a numeric stash scene ID which broke addon content (`faptap:2074…` → "no script loaded"). Extracts `handy.ParseFunscriptPoints` for the WS load op
- `handyConnectionMode` persisted in server-side UI config instead of per-browser localForage, so incognito windows and the Quest resolve the local client (the BLE link is a server-side singleton)
- Reflect an already-established server-side BLE session on mount (`LocalHandyInteractive.attach`); Bluetooth status/connect/disconnect panel added to Settings for local mode
- Hardened reconnection: validate the link with a first `ClockSync` round-trip before publishing the session, so a flaky WinRT reconnect that yields a live GATT handle but an unresponsive device no longer reports `Connected=true`; retry once after a settle delay; assign `engine.session` only on success

### fix(handy): stub BLE transport on platforms tinygo/bluetooth doesn't support (d57069c30)

`tinygo.org/x/bluetooth` only ships an `Adapter` for linux/darwin/windows, breaking the FreeBSD leg of `build-cc-all`. Gate `ble.go` to those three OSes and add a stub transport reporting BLE unsupported elsewhere. `tinygo.org/x/bluetooth` promoted to a direct dependency.

### feat(handy): add local BLE control, bypassing the cloud API (1b81d565e)

Fully local control path for The Handy via the vendor's `hdy_rpc` BLE protocol, so scenes drive entirely over Bluetooth through the server — no handyfeeling.com round trip, no rate limits, no funscript data leaving the LAN.

- `pkg/handy`: hand-rolled protobuf codec (cross-validated against the vendor's official JS bundle via golden vectors), BLE GATT transport (`tinygo.org/x/bluetooth`), RPC session with median-filtered clock sync, HSP playback engine (buffer top-up/seek/drift correction), connection manager
- `internal/api`: `/handy/ws` WebSocket bridge taking small JSON ops (connect/load/play/pause/sync/stroke/hdsp/hamp/hvp/estop); scenes read and fed to the device entirely server-side
- UI: `LocalHandyInteractive` implements the existing `IInteractiveClient` interface as a drop-in, so flat and VR players work unchanged; new Settings > Interface > "Handy Connection Mode" (Cloud/Local) toggle swaps the client live

### fix(vr): replace overlapping Shuffle pill with compact icon (e12dd475a)

Replace the wide Shuffle pill (which overlapped the mode toggle's Scenes tab) with a 44px round ⇄ icon anchored left of the header search pill. Bundled **`fix(pmvhaven): follow CDN host migration`** — PMVHaven retired `video.pmvhaven.com` and moved assets to an OVH S3 host under identical paths; `CanonicalAssetURL`/`IsAssetURL` host-swap stored URLs on read at a single chokepoint so card JSON, `/sources`, and the ffmpeg funscript input all resolve to the live host; proxies accept both hosts.

### feat(HeroBanner): stall detection, error handling, dynamic slide timing (f22fb35b3, 995e7d0ba)

Add video error handling with automatic slide transition, plus stall detection and dynamic per-slide timing so a stalled or failed hero video advances instead of freezing the banner.

### feat(vr): drag-to-scrub in VRControlPanel; update IHittable interface (a6f297081)

Add drag-to-scrub on the VR control-panel scrubber, extending the `IHittable` interface to carry drag state through the controller-ray pipeline.

### fix(sqlite): honor exclude_ids in fast-path ID queries (f4ea88916)

`findIDsFast` for scenes, images, galleries and performers bypassed `FindFilterType.ExcludeIds` entirely (each is a hand-rolled perf shortcut that never inherited the slow path's exclude handling). This duplicated scenes on the VR Home wall's Recent grid, where the continue-watching prefix relies on `exclude_ids` to avoid showing in-progress scenes twice. All four fixed.

### feat(vr): show A/B loop marks on the VR scrubber (cf5aaaad7)

Gold tick at the pending A mark and a shaded green A–B segment with boundary ticks once the loop is armed, giving the A/B button state a visible anchor on the timeline instead of relying on button glow alone.

### feat(vr): feature walkthrough page in onboarding; fix mode-toggle overlap (439c6b6d9)

Split the one-time onboarding modal into two pages (gesture legend + a walkthrough of captions, interactive scripts, chapters/looping, and comfort vignette) with Back/Next nav and page dots. Fixes the mode toggle overlapping the new help "?" button.

### feat(vr): search/sort parity + visual polish for in-VR Scenes panel (d87bbe43d)

- Search pill and tap-to-cycle sort chip added to the peripheral Scenes browser (during playback), backed by `VRCarouselLibrary`'s new generation-guarded `setQuery({sort, search})` — independent of the Home wall's own search/sort
- Rows get the Home wall's card-polish language (gradient background, resting hairline, two-stroke hover/now-playing glow)
- Fix the Browse auto-hide timer eating searches (typing on the keyboard touches no controller, so the panel faded mid-search); `setScenesSearch` now refreshes `lastActivity` on every keystroke
- Consolidate `VRHomePanel`'s hardcoded accent/gold hex onto `vrTheme.ts` (`VRT.accentRGB`/`goldRGB`); add a whole-scene loop toggle (`native video.loop`) next to the chapter A–B button

### feat(vr): grow Home wall grids to fill the taller wall (cf3af6f7c, ffbca25a2)

Scene grid → 4×3 (12/page); movie posters → 8×3 (24/page, narrower cards); galleries → 20/page. Grid page sizes centralized in `types.ts` (`VR_SCENE_PAGE_SIZE`, `VR_GROUP_PAGE_SIZE`, `VR_GALLERY_PAGE_SIZE`) so `VRHomePanel` and all data-source libraries can't drift out of sync. Filter rail widened for layout balance.

### feat(vr): free-text search via Meta WebXR system keyboard on Home wall (e5b64fa60)

Search pill on the Home wall header summons the Quest system keyboard (`VRSystemKeyboard`) and threads the typed term through `IVRHomeQuery.search` to every content source — local scenes/galleries/movies (GraphQL `q`) plus FapTap and PMVHaven sidecars (REST `q`) — with debounced live re-querying. *(The system keyboard was later replaced with an in-scene canvas keyboard — see d93c71447 — after it was found to crash the Quest browser.)*

### feat(vr): instant panel dismiss, auto-hide meshes, Quest-style UI audio, polish (dca6bb4ed)

- Click on empty space (or the flat screen) instantly toggles the control panels via a fast dismiss fade, independent of the inactivity timeout
- Controller and hand meshes hide together with the panels (`VRDeviceModels.setVisible`)
- Synthesized WebAudio UI cues (hover/press/open/close) across the control bar, side panels and hub, matching native Quest shell feedback; new "UI sound effects" toggle (default on)
- Introduce `vrTheme.ts` token system across `VRControls`/`VRInfoPanels` for a cohesive glass/accent look with new hover states

### fix(vr): eliminate passthrough panel flicker with per-frame work budget (8a99ac312)

Interaction frames stacked a full panel raster + full-canvas GPU upload + thumb-popup upload on top of the mandatory per-frame video-texture upload; over transparent AR compositing the dropped frame had no opaque stale layer to reproject, so the UI blinked out against the camera feed. `VRCanvasPanel` now caps panel work at one raster-or-upload per frame across all panels during playback, staging raster (frame N) and upload (frame N+1) separately. Also: dome grip-drag signals `onDomeDragActive` for tessellation swap; scene-switch source selection consults `MediaCapabilities` to demote an undecodable direct stream ahead of playback; new `VRStatusMonitor` clock/battery cluster on the control bar.

### feat(vr): grip-drag to reorient dome video, recenter matches gaze pitch (6e3731989)

Grab and re-angle 180/360/fisheye video with the grip button, following the controller ray in yaw/pitch (roll pinned to preserve stereo disparity). Empty squeeze still recenters (distinguished from a drag by an angular-movement threshold on release); recenter now matches gaze pitch too, so a quick squeeze while lying down snaps the video to the ceiling. Offset shared by both video paths (shader dome + compositor equirect layer) and survives rebuilds/scene switches.

### fix: ImageList lightbox nav ignores grid/list toggle (bc7c403b4)

Include `filter.displayMode` in the lightbox state memo so toggling grid/list view updates lightbox navigation/filmstrip visibility.

### fix(hooks): stale-closure and rules-of-hooks bugs across five components (711bdb641)

- `RenamerTargetSelector`: move `useConfigurationQuery` before the early return so hook order stays consistent when the scenes query errors
- `ScenePlayer`: track `scene.start_point`/`end_point` in the activity-sync effect so editing segment bounds mid-playback isn't ignored
- `MovieFy`: include `isManualEntry`/`addMovieFyEntry` in `handleMovieFyQueue` deps so manual URLs reliably save
- `Tagger`: recompute pending tag/performer counts when related config toggles change
- `StashTagIdentification`: include `loading` in `handleAnalyze` deps so its re-entrancy guard can't run on a stale closure

### feat(vr): compact Scenes panel list with floating hover preview (c9e04f0fa)

Replace the two-large-card carousel in the immersive Scenes panel with a compact row list (small thumbnail + title/studio), fitting ~6 rows instead of 2. Row hover floats a larger preview above the panel, angled to match it, reusing the shared marker/chapter hover popup mechanism instead of compositing video inline.

### feat(scene): support multiple funscripts per scene with in-VR switching (a9ddb0e43)

Adds a `scene_funscripts` table so a scene can hold several assigned `.funscript` files, with `scenes.funscript_path` kept as a pointer to the active one. Scripts auto-detected from the video's directory on scan and via a background startup task for VR-set scenes; manually added/removed from the scene edit panel. The immersive Handy panel gains a script-switcher that re-uploads to the device and regenerates the heatmap on selection. Bumps `appSchemaVersion` so migration 99 runs; adds the missing 190° Fisheye (SBS) option to the bulk Edit Scenes VR-mode dropdown.

### feat(vr): require manual activation of Handy device in immersive player (1ef4b484c)

Interactive devices no longer auto-engage when a VR scene plays. The device stays idle until the user taps a green "Activate" control in the VR Handy panel; "Stop" disarms. The global `InteractiveContext` auto-connect (which the 2D desktop player relies on) is left intact; a VR-scoped arm/disarm gate (`handyArmed`) controls only whether VR playback drives the device. `interactiveEnabled` gate in `useVRPlayback` skips funscript upload and suppresses play/seek while disarmed.

### feat(vr): chapter card previews with video and image fallbacks (a25a31798)

Chapter cards in the immersive player now show video previews with image fallbacks.

### fix(package): remove hardcoded BUILD_DATE from server script (8a5d0b846)

### fix(ui): virtualized studio/tag grids blank above 40 per-page; single-card stretch (c5972e6e2)

Studios/Tags pages rendered no cards once `itemsPerPage` pushed the count past the virtualization threshold (50): the virtualizers bound to `parentRef.parentElement` as the scroll container, but these pages scroll via the window/body. Switch to `useWindowVirtualizer` with `scrollMargin`. Also fix single-card grids ignoring the zoom slider — CSS Grid `auto-fit` collapses unpopulated tracks and stretches the sole card; switch to `auto-fill`.

### fix(vr): surface alpha-mask edge softness as a passthrough panel control (9b5cab0b9)

Expose the embedded alpha-mask's blur radius and threshold band (previously hardcoded in the fisheye shader) as a 6th "Edge softness" slider, mirroring chroma mode's "Falloff".

### fix(watcher): sync scan options to backend and wire auto-identify (51a6110c9)

Settings > Tasks > Scan checkboxes only persisted to browser localForage, never to the backend `defaults.scan_task` config the watcher reads — so the watcher silently skipped all post-scan generation (phash included). `LibraryTasks` now pushes scan options to the backend via `configureDefaults`, on change and once on load. Also adds the missing `ScanAutoIdentify` handling to the watcher's synchronous scan path, hardens the pending-file lock check against read-only-mounted files, and adds logging.

### fix(vr): passthrough hardening — matte edge blur, panel close on hub return (713a536ae, ff6799da1)

- Blur the SLR corner-packed alpha mask by averaging a 3×3 texel neighbourhood before thresholding, rounding off the macroblock-quantized staircased matte boundary (a value-only smoothstep couldn't fix the blocky shape)
- `setLobbyMode(true)` now also resets `ptPanelOpen`, so the passthrough adjustment panel no longer stays open over the hub after exiting a scene

### feat(vr): mixed-reality passthrough with in-headset chroma-key panel (6d52f381f, 679f982d8)

AR-first immersive sessions (`immersive-ar` with `immersive-vr` fallback) so the hub and player can each independently show camera passthrough without touching playback. Hub gets a "Passthrough while browsing" toggle; the player gets a DeoVR-style adjustment panel (PT button) — on/off, Hue/Saturation/Brightness/Color range/Falloff sliders, a "Sample from video" matte picker, and Reset. Player passthrough prefers SLR's embedded corner-packed alpha matte for `_alpha`-tagged files, with weighted-HSV chroma-keying as a manual fallback. Opaque blackout-shell geometry occludes the camera on non-passthrough paths (AR sessions no longer get a free black void behind transparent clears).

### Update README.md (896060443)

### fix(moviefy): add AddMovieFyEntry mutation document to graphql source (4891e85ef)

The mutation hook existed only as a manual edit to `generated-graphql.ts`, so `make generate` wiped it every run. Moving the document into `ui/v2.5/graphql/queries/MovieFy.graphql` makes codegen produce the hook permanently.

### feat(moviefy): covers, AdultEmpire sort, manual URL entry + DB write-back; feat(player): fill/crop mode (f70c5494b)

MovieFy: front_image covers in search results (90×126px); AdultEmpire results sorted to top; manual URL input (paste any scraper-supported URL without a DB entry); after scraping a manual URL, write the result back to `moviefy.db` via `addMovieFyEntry` (SQLite upsert-by-URL). ScenePlayer: new fill/crop mode (Z key + control bar button) toggling `object-fit:cover` to eliminate letterbox/pillarbox on SD content, via a self-contained `fill-mode.ts` videojs plugin.

### feat(vr): flat media wall grip-drag repositioning with gaze snap (474d80967)

Port the flat (2D) media wall onto the same grip-drag machinery as the VR Home wall. The flat screen is world-anchored (parented to the scene, not the rotated `videoGroup`) and seeded at real head eye height via `placeFlatInstant()`. Grip grabs it and rides the controller ray with auto `lookAt`; thumbstick Y pushes/pulls distance; empty squeeze recenters it in front of gaze. `VRControllerInput`'s single draggable generalized to a set. Bundled: **`fix(pmvhaven): proxy media through backend to fix CORS for flat scenes`** (a `/media` proxy with Range/ETag forwarded) and **`feat(moviefy): folder-scoped file browser for scene selection column`**.

### feat(groups, scenes): redesign GroupsHero + inline URL scraping in scene list (839be46ee)

GroupsHero: Ken Burns backdrop drift, Netflix-style pacing with pause-on-hover, poster art with color halo and fanned back cover, two-row ambient scene-preview carousel. SceneListTable: a "URLs" column with inline editing (commits on blur) and a per-URL scrape affordance; lazy-loaded `SceneScrapeDialog` writes resolved entity IDs back to the scene on confirm.

### feat(vr): PMVHaven content mode (5th sidecar catalog) (6be5dd866)

Adds PMVHaven as a new premium VR Home content mode alongside FapTap.
- Backend: `internal/pmvhaven/` (`db.go` sidecar SQLite reader, `funscript.go` on-demand audio→funscript via ffmpeg + `analyzer.py`); `routes_pmvhaven.go` (`/pmvhaven/*` catalog/detail/sources/funscript); `pmvhaven_path` config key
- Frontend: `pmvhavenLibrary.ts` (`PmvHavenHomeLibrary` implements `IVRHomeDataSource`); 5th "pmvhaven" content-mode tab (locked until DB present); all-flat media filter (All + ★ only); `switchPmvScene` action; flat-screen drag handle uses a `Mesh` not `Sprite` (fixes flat-scene compositor freeze from `Sprite.raycast()` needing a camera in the XR loop)

### fix(faptap): proxy faptap.net thumbnails through backend to fix CORS (c29f8a05b)

`faptap.net/api/assets/thumbnails/` sends no CORS headers, failing `crossOrigin="anonymous"` loads silently in the VR canvas. New `GET /faptap/thumb?url=` accepts only `faptap.net` URLs, fetches server-side, pipes through with upstream Content-Type and a 1-day cache. `proxyIfNeeded()` rewrites `faptap.net` thumbnail/preview URLs at map time; CDN URLs pass through.

### fix(vr): adjust main wall panel height to eye-height (0793c7d9e)

### feat(vr): movie covers, scene-card tags, bigger cards, fix movie-detail previews (b13cfa1d9)

- Movie detail: front + back covers rendered side-by-side via `drawImageContain` (`backUrl` added to `IVRGroupEntry`); fix hover previews only showing one scene (`allLoadedScenes()` is now source-aware and returns the drilled-in group's scenes)
- Scene cards: tag-chip row added to the caption (`tags` mapped into `IVRSceneEntry`); cards enlarged by dropping the scene grid 4×3 → 3×2; mode-aware `perPage` getter keeps galleries/posters at 12 while scenes use 6

### VRGalleryViewerPanel / VRHomePanel: justified gallery grid, lightbox fix, slideshow relocation (411eddf90, e281cb3d1)

- Fix lightbox lockup: `activate()` returned null when the lightbox was open, making prev/next/back/close-grid unreachable via trigger tap; now resolves the tapped region directly in lightbox mode
- Replace the rigid fixed-cell gallery grids with greedy row-packing (Google Photos style): covers packed by aspect ratio to fill the grid width, row height varying by combined aspect ratio
- Move the slideshow toggle next to the Back button, styled identically

### feat(vr): server-paged carousel, tag drill-down, controller disconnect guard, rim-light (ffd988a50)

- New `VRCarouselLibrary` owns lazy server-side page fetching for the VR Scenes side panel; `VRScenesPanel` converted from one-shot `setScenes()` to a `setPageRequester()`/`requestedPages`/`reachedEnd` model
- Tag drill-down: an in-headset tag tap on the info panel drills the Home wall, matching the performer/studio path
- `VRControllerInput`: per-controller connected/disconnected events; stale `pressController`/`pressObject` cleared on disconnect so dangling drag state can't outlive the physical controller
- `VRDeviceModels`: rim-light fragment shader applied once per material via a `WeakSet`

### feat(vr): server-paged Home wall + stabilized controller rays and device models (c0d9120b4)

- Replace the ≤200-scene client-side load with full server-side paging via `VRHomeLibrary` (`IVRHomeDataSource`): `findScenes` in 12-scene blocks, authoritative `totalCount`, studios/performers rail from `findStudios`/`findPerformers` sorted by `scenes_count`, media counts via `per_page:0`. All queries generation-guarded so stale post-filter responses are dropped
- Preserve "Continue watching": in-progress scenes (`resume_time>30`) float to the top of Recent as a virtual page-0 prefix, removed from the date stream via `exclude_ids`
- `VRHomePanel` holds only current±1 pages (`pageCache`) + `totalCount`, drawing skeleton cards while loading; `getNextSceneId` is async so auto-advance resolves across server pages
- Stabilize controller rays with a One-Euro adaptive low-pass filter; widen grid dead-zone and add a 90ms press settle window so selecting a card no longer shifts the grid; add `VRDeviceModels` (controller + hand meshes)

### feat(vr): in-headset Handy stroke-zone slider with server confirmation (11b4ffb6d)

Dual-handle range slider in the VR Handy panel to adjust the stroke-zone min/max envelope without leaving the scene. Press grabs the nearer handle, drag updates live (handles can't cross), release dispatches `setHandyStroke` once (so the device isn't flooded mid-drag), routing through `setHampStroke` which clamps both HAMP and funscript (HSSP) motion. Explicit feedback: "Saving…" chip on release → green "Range set" on resolve (auto-clears 1.6s) or red "Failed" on reject.

### Responsive layout: raise mobile/desktop breakpoint to 1281px; VR entry point polish (b34e71ae3)

Raise the mobile/desktop breakpoint from 992px to 1281px so the Quest 3's 1280px viewport and large tablets get the mobile drawer layout instead of a cramped desktop nav (`xl` adjusted 1200→1536px to keep MUI breakpoints ascending). `EnterVRHomeButton` gains a `prominent` full-width indigo-gradient variant for the mobile drawer footer; MUI `Vrpano` icon replaced with `public/vr.svg`; on mobile the VR button is pinned next to the nav brand. Both instances return null on non-XR browsers.

### fix(vr): prevent Quest compositor crash on in-XR scene switch (b67639a80)

In-VR scene switching crashed the player after 1–3 switches: `handleSwitchScene` drained the `<video>` (`removeAttribute 'src'` + `load()`) while the old WebXR media layer was still bound and sampling the element directly, triggering a synchronous compositor fault. The fault was invisible to leak checks (the surface is owned by the compositor process, so `performance.memory` and `renderer.info` stayed flat). Fix: `XRSessionManager.prepareSourceSwap()` destroys the live media layer, drops back to the shader dome, and pushes a video-less `renderState` so the compositor stops referencing the `<video>` before React drains it; `onVideoReady` then rebuilds a fresh media layer. Called before every drain site. Verified on Quest 3: 6 consecutive switches, zero crashes, heap flat at 61MB.

### perf(vr): eliminate immersive-player playback and panel-interaction jitter (9575ee4a3)

Diagnosed on-device (Quest 3) with the vrlog jitter profiler; steady state went from frequent hover/redraw hitches to ~84fps.
- **Layered hover compositing:** a hover state change used to re-rasterize the entire control panel (~25ms canvas block) on the XR thread. The panel is now cached in its non-hovered state on an offscreen base canvas, rebuilt only on real content change; a hover change blits the cached base and patches only the one hovered element. A hover redraw drops from a full re-raster to one `drawImage` plus one element
- **Activity + play-count saves off the render-critical path:** both `saveActivity` and `incrementPlayCount` ran `cache.modify` on the watched Scene query, re-rendering the whole immersive tree on the XR main thread (50–100ms longtasks, one ~288ms stall). Overridden with a no-op update in the VR path; the server still records `resume_time`/`play_duration`/`play_count`, and the 2D player keeps its optimistic cache behaviour
- **Telemetry:** opt-in NDJSON vrlog profiler (`?vrlog=1` → `scripts/vrlog-server.mjs`) with a `?vrprofile=jitter` scope recording per-frame render/UI/input/upload cost and longtasks

### feat(vr): WebXR Media Layers video path + three.js 0.184 (b8c52d76b)

Render flat/180/360 immersive video through an `XRMediaBinding` composition layer (compositor samples the `<video>` directly) instead of the eye-buffer shader dome — visibly sharper/brighter and roughly halving per-frame GPU.
- Upgrade three 0.154.0 → 0.184.0 (+ `@types/three`) for current WebXR
- Equirect layer for 180/360 (stereo via layout + `invertStereo`), quad layer for flat; recenter rotates the equirect transform. Media layer is the default; the shader dome is retained only for fisheye190 (no composition-layer type can un-distort dual fisheye) and as an automatic fallback on devices without the Layers API
- Insert the media layer beneath three's projection layer via `updateRenderState`; skip the per-frame `VideoTexture` upload while active
- Fix flashing black-rectangle artifact: a transparent XR framebuffer makes the Quest compositor fill reprojected regions with black tiles; clear the projection layer transparent *only* while the media layer composites beneath it
- Add `vrDebug` flags `nomedialayer`/`opaque` for on-device A/B

### feat(vr): immersive-home settings panel, thumbstick nav, and auto-advance (5e7f2e796)

In-headset settings panel on the Home wall (via a gear button replacing shuffle): toggle gaze auto-launch, configurable gaze-dwell delay (1.5/2.5/4s, default 2.5s), sound-on/muted toggle — all persisted to localStorage and applied live. Also: a "funscript" media filter with per-filter scene counts; thumbstick navigation for the scene grid and filter rail; auto-advance to the next scene when one ends. `VRTheatreEnv` removed — flat scenes now play on a bare curved screen in darkness.

### feat(vr): expand immersive home with grid tiles, media filter, funscript indicators, theatre mode (d30fbbf25)

- 3rd scene row; performer/studio list replaced with a 2-column tile grid (portraits/logos + count badges)
- `[All/VR/2D]` media-type toggle (`setMediaFilter`); VR carousel filtered to VR-only in JS so studio/performer tiles reflect the full library
- Scene cards: heatmap strip at thumbnail base when `paths.interactive_heatmap` present; orange "FS" pill when interactive + funscript attached
- `VRTheatreEnv` (new, later removed): cinema room for flat-media playback; flat scenes get a gently curved cylindrical screen replacing the flat plane
- Video-texture flicker fix: gate `needsUpdate` on `readyState >= 2` so a segment-boundary stall preserves the last good GPU frame

### feat(vr): in-session scene switching with live browse panel (e9b1359b8)

Tap a scene card in the VR browser to switch content without leaving the XR session — the video swaps, info panel updates, and Browse closes automatically. New `switchScene` action keeps taps in-session; `liveScene` state re-keys all downstream hooks (sources, markers, info, VTT, heatmap, captions) without touching the XR session or dome geometry; `updateSceneInfo` removes the old panel object from `uiGroup` before disposing it (fixing old/new title flicker); "NOW PLAYING" gold badge on the active card.

### feat: add immersive VR home experience with curved scene grid and ambient backdrop (ca3741008)

Introduces the full spatial home/lobby, opening directly from the navbar without an active scene.
- `EnterVRHomeButton`: global "Enter VR" button in `MainNavbar`, portalled to `document.body`, hidden when immersive-vr is unsupported
- `ImmersiveVRPlayer`: scene prop accepts null; `LOBBY_SCENE` sentinel; `goHome` pauses playback and returns to the lobby; auto-play on selection
- `VRLobbyBackdrop`: calm ambient environment — deep twilight gradient sky sphere, 700-star drifting starfield with breathing opacity, faint floor grid
- `VRHomePanel` (rewritten): single large curved panel (radius 2.65m, 2200×1000 canvas) merging a Studios/Performers filter rail with a 4×2 scene grid; `pressZone` disambiguates rail scroll from drag-pagination; eased page transitions

### fix: apply upstream memory leak fixes and resolve generate parallelism explosion

Incorporates fixes from upstream PRs #6796 and #6845, plus a Vexxx-specific
memory issue caused by double-layered parallelism in phash generation.

**Upstream PR #6845 — task_generate.go consumer loop**

`internal/manager/task_generate.go`: Changed `break` → `continue` in the
generate queue consumer loop. The 200,000-capacity channel producer (scene/image
walker) would block indefinitely on send when the buffer was full after the
consumer exited on cancellation, holding its database read transaction open and
preventing further DB work. `continue` ensures the channel drains until the
producer closes it.

**Upstream PR #6796 — job manager graveyard memory leak**

`pkg/job/job.go`: Added `statusCopy()` method that copies only serialisable
status fields (ID, Status, Details, Description, Progress, StartTime, EndTime,
AddTime, Error), deliberately excluding `exec`, `cancelFunc`, and `outerCtx`.

`pkg/job/manager.go`:
- `removeJob`: set `job.exec = nil` before moving job to graveyard. The graveyard
  retains `*Job` for status reporting but no longer holds a reference to the
  executor (e.g. `ScanJob`), which in turn held a 200,000-capacity `fileQueue`
  channel and the `scanner` struct.
- `notifyNewJob`, `notifyJobUpdate`, `removeJob` subscription send, `GetJob`,
  `GetQueue`: changed `*j` → `j.statusCopy()` so no caller or subscriber ever
  receives a copy that includes the `exec` reference.

`pkg/job/task.go`: Changed `return` → `continue` in `TaskQueue.executer()` —
same channel-drain fix as above applied to the task queue.

`internal/manager/task_scan.go`: Changed `return` → `continue` in
`processQueue`. The scan goroutine was exiting immediately on cancellation,
leaving `queueFiles()` blocked on a full `fileQueue` send and holding its DB
read transaction open indefinitely.

**Vexxx-specific — phash double-parallelism fix**

`pkg/hash/videophash/phash.go`: Reverted `generateSprite` to upstream's
sequential 25-screenshot loop. The previous Vexxx implementation spawned 25
goroutines per phash task gated by a `runtime.NumCPU()` semaphore. Combined
with the outer `sizedwaitgroup` (`parallelTasks = NumCPU/4+1` on auto-detect),
this created a multiplicative explosion of concurrent FFmpeg decode processes
when Generate Scene Covers + Previews + Sprites + Phashes were all enabled
together — pinning memory at 99% and locking the machine. The outer
`sizedwaitgroup` already provides the correct level of cross-task parallelism.
`PhashOptions` (Start, Duration) for segment-aware phash generation is fully
preserved.

**Additional — generate path filtering**

`graphql/schema/types/metadata.graphql`: Added `paths: [String!]` field to
`GenerateMetadataInput`.
`internal/manager/task_generate.go`: Added `filterStashPaths()` helper; wired
`paths` through `queueTasks` / `queueScenesTasks` / `queueImagesTasks` so
generate tasks can be scoped to specific library paths.
`pkg/image/query.go`: Added `FilterFromPaths()` mirroring `scene.FilterFromPaths()`.

**Cleanup**

`internal/manager/task_generate_preview.go`: Removed four noisy `logger.Infof`
debug lines that fired on every preview task for segment scenes
(StartPoint/EndPoint logging). Segment logic and `HasPreview` flag update retained.
`internal/manager/task_scan.go`: Added startup log showing parallel task count.

### feat(ui): MUI style upgrades across Settings panels + fix log level filtering (12bad78f)

Scrapers & Stash-box:
- `ui/v2.5/src/components/Settings/SettingsScrapingPanel.tsx`: Replace plain HTML table/ul/li with MUI Table (size="small", hover rows); Chip badges (outlined) for scrape types; MUI Link components for URLs
- `ui/v2.5/src/components/Settings/StashBoxConfiguration.tsx`: Replace div.setting endpoint rows with MUI Table (Name / Endpoint / Actions columns, hover rows); outlined Edit/Delete buttons in Stack; Add button below table; widen endpoint edit modal to `maxWidth="md"` fullWidth

Logs panel:
- Replace `div.logs` with scrollable Paper (variant="outlined", 60vh max); Chip severity badges per log level with monospace font; warning/error rows get coloured backgrounds
- Add `LOG_LEVEL_ORDER` including `Progress` in correct ordinal position — fixes Progress entries always being hidden (`indexOf` returned -1 against old array)
- Fix `filterByLogLevel` to use `LOG_LEVEL_ORDER` for both sides of the comparison; unknown levels fall through to always-shown
- Correct Chip colour mapping: Info → "info" (solid blue) instead of "success" (green); Progress → "primary" filled; trace/debug render outlined (muted)

---

### feat(ui): MUI style upgrades for Scene File Info and History tabs (ff765d98)

SceneFileInfoPanel:
- Replace `dl.scene-file-info`/`details-list` with MUI Table InfoRow entries for all file metadata (hash, checksum, phash, filesize, mod time, duration, dimensions, framerate, bitrate, codecs, path)
- "Primary file" badge → `Chip size="small" color="primary"`; PHash link uses react-router `Link` for internal nav
- Scene-level stream URL, funscript, interactive speed, stash IDs, and scene URLs consolidated into a single Table
- Action buttons: `className="edit-button"` → `size="small" variant="outlined"`; Delete retains `variant="contained" color="error"`

SceneHistoryPanel:
- Replace ul/li history list with Table size="small" hover rows; timestamps use monospace Typography; delete icon right-aligned
- Section headers → `Stack direction="row"` with Typography subtitle1 + Counter; sections separated by Divider
- `play_duration` → single-row Table with muted label cell; only rendered when duration > 0
- HistoryMenu: replace `slotProps.backdrop.invisible` with app-wide `hideBackdrop + disableScrollLock + pointerEvents:none` pattern; eliminates page dimming when menu is open

---

### fix(ui): restore scene cover image upload button; deep-link card counts to detail tabs (4d86e5b4)

SceneEditPanel:
- Replace orphaned hidden `<input type="file">` with `<ImageInput isEditing onImageChange onImageURL>` — restores the "Browse for Image" button with clipboard/URL popover support
- Remove stale `scrape_image_text` hint block below image input

StudioCard:
- All `PopoverCountButton` url props changed from NavUtils filtered list views to `/studios/:id/<tab>` deep links (scenes, galleries, images, performers, groups)

TagCard:
- All `PopoverCountButton` url props changed to `/tags/:id/<tab>` deep links matching tag detail page tabs (scenes, images, galleries, groups, markers, performers, studios)

---

### fix(dlna): remove unused sceneFilter param from getSortDirection; refactor(ui): upgrade SceneDetailPanel to MUI styling (ff028897)

- `internal/dlna`: Remove unused `sceneFilter` parameter from `getSortDirection`
- `ui/v2.5/src/components/Scenes/SceneDetailPanel.tsx`: Replace h6/p/div with MUI Table, Typography, Box, Divider; metadata rows in compact Table size="small"; reorder layout to Details → metadata table → Tags → Performers; remove dead `sceneDetailsWidth` variable

---

### refactor(ui): polish SceneDetailPanel tags and SceneSegmentsPanel source info (2a83cab5)

- `SceneDetailPanel`: Wrap tags chip list in a scrollable Box (maxHeight 9rem, overflowY auto)
- `SceneSegmentsPanel`: Replace Source File info Box with Typography subtitle1 heading + Divider + Table size="small" rows for Path, Duration, Resolution, and Codec

---

### refactor(ui): upgrade GalleryDetailPanel and GalleryFileInfoPanel to MUI (27aeb734)

GalleryDetailPanel:
- Replace h6 metadata rows with labelSx/valueSx Table size="small"; replace h6/p.pre details block with Typography subtitle1 + body2; wrap tags in scrollable Box (maxHeight 9rem); wrap performers in horizontal-scroll snap Box
- Layout order: details → Divider → metadata table → tags → performers

GalleryFileInfoPanel:
- Replace `dl.details-list` with single Table size="small" (checksum, mod time, path rows); primary-file indicator as Typography body2 above table
- Upgrade URLs section heading to subtitle1 fontWeight={600} + Divider

---

### feat(ui/galleries): add studio logo section and per-performer scene filter chips (4cfc0c57)

- `GalleryDetailPanel`: Add studio section below tags showing studio logo (or name fallback) linked to studio page; logo in explicit 8rem container for consistent height
- `GalleryEditPanel`: Add per-performer filter chips above SceneSelect; clicking a chip filters scene dropdown to scenes featuring that performer; clicking again clears; SceneSelect remounted on filter change to bypass AsyncSelect's `defaultOptions` cache
- `ui/v2.5/src/locales/en-GB.json`: Add `filter_by_performer` / `filter_by_performer_active` locale keys

---

### feat(ui/images): upgrade ImageDetailPanel and ImageFileInfoPanel to MUI (29b30be4)

ImageDetailPanel:
- Replace h6/bootstrap-grid markup with MUI Table for metadata rows (created_at, updated_at, scene_code, photographer); add Divider + Typography section headings; scrollable tags and horizontal-scroll performer cards

ImageFileInfoPanel:
- Replace `dl.details-list` with MUI Table rows for all file metadata (checksum, phash, filesize, mod_time, dimensions, path); phash value links to pHash image match search; remove TextField/URLField/URLsField imports

---

### feat(ui/tags): upgrade TagPopover tooltip with icon count buttons and always-visible image (e5c7885d)

- Replace text count links with `PopoverCountButton` (icon + count) matching TagCard pattern; use `showZero={false}` to hide zero counts
- Remove `default=true` exclusion so tag image/placeholder always renders in tooltip

---

### fix(ui/tags): constrain tag header image to prevent layout overflow (ce3b0db1)

- Cap `DetailImage` to `maxHeight: 16rem` and override JS-set width attribute with `width/height: auto` to prevent oversized or portrait images stretching the tag page header

---

### fix(ui): fix grid overlapping at 40+ items; tag tooltip & list polish (7fed031c)

- `SmartTagCardGrid`, `SmartImageGridCard`, `SmartSceneCardsGrid`: Always delegate to plain CSS grid variants, bypassing broken virtualizers whose absolute-positioned rows were computed against the wrong scroll origin
- `TagPopover`: Replace text links with PopoverCountButton icon+count badges; always render tag image (remove `hasImage` guard)
- `Tag.tsx`: Constrain `DetailImage` header to `maxHeight: 16rem` / `width: auto`
- `TagList.tsx`: Fix lint errors (duplicate `StashService` import, unused intl, use-before-define, no-shadow); fix TS errors with `GQL.useTagDestroyMutation`, real Apollo result in `extraOperations`, remove `onInvertSelection`

---

### feat: make scene_marker.primary_tag_id nullable (ON DELETE SET NULL) (f0b99215)

Migration 88: Recreate `scene_markers` with nullable `primary_tag_id` and `ON DELETE SET NULL` FK constraint. Deleting a tag now clears its markers' primary tag via DB cascade rather than blocking deletion.

Backend:
- `SceneMarker.PrimaryTagID`: `int` → `*int` throughout the stack; SQLite store uses `null.Int` row type with LEFT JOINs; `PrimaryTag` resolver returns nil when PrimaryTagID is nil
- `resolver.go`, `routes_scene.go`, `export.go`, `marker_import.go`: nil guards added; `TagsDestroy` removes `deleteMarkers` parameter; `tag.Destroy()` removes pre-delete guard

GraphQL schema:
- `SceneMarker.primary_tag`: `Tag!` → `Tag` (nullable); `TagDestroyInput`: remove `delete_markers` field; `tagsDestroy` mutation: remove `delete_markers` argument

Frontend:
- `DeleteTagDialog`: Remove "also delete markers" checkbox; change alert severity warning → info; always delete all selected tags; locale strings updated

### feat: add Recycle Bin for soft-delete and restore of entities (24aee012)

Adds a Recycle Bin that snapshots entity data before deletion and allows full restoration including all junction-table associations.

New files:
- `graphql/schema/types/recycle_bin.graphql` — RecycleBinEntry type, queries, mutations
- `internal/api/resolver_mutation_recycle_bin.go` — Restore/Purge/PurgeAll resolvers
- `internal/api/resolver_query_recycle_bin.go` — FindRecycleBinEntries/Count resolver
- `pkg/models/model_recycle_bin.go` — RecycleBinEntry domain model
- `pkg/models/repository_recycle_bin.go` — RecycleBin store interface
- `pkg/sqlite/recycle_bin.go` — SQLite implementation with full snapshot/restore logic

### feat(recycle-bin): add persistent History log tab (75d34334)

Adds a "History" second-level tab to the Recycle Bin settings panel that permanently records every delete, restore, and purge event.

New files:
- `pkg/sqlite/migrations/90_recycle_bin_history.up.sql` — `recycle_bin_history` table (entity_type, entity_id, entity_name, action, actioned_at, group_id, notes); indexed by date and entity

Backend:
- `pkg/models/model_recycle_bin.go` — new `RecycleBinHistoryEntry` struct
- `pkg/models/repository_recycle_bin.go` — `FindHistory` / `CountHistory` added to `RecycleBinReader` interface
- `pkg/sqlite/recycle_bin.go` — `recycleBinHistoryRow`, `buildNotes()` (human-readable association summary e.g. "3 scenes · 2 secondary markers"), `record()` writes deleted event, Restore/Purge/PurgeAll write history events; `appSchemaVersion` bumped to 90
- `graphql/schema/types/recycle_bin.graphql` — `RecycleBinHistoryEntry` type
- `graphql/schema/schema.graphql` — `recycleBinHistory` / `recycleBinHistoryCount` queries
- `internal/api/resolver_query_recycle_bin.go` — two new resolvers

Frontend:
- `ui/v2.5/graphql/queries/recycle-bin.graphql` — `RecycleBinHistoryEntryData` fragment; `RecycleBinHistory` / `RecycleBinHistoryCount` queries
- `ui/v2.5/src/components/Settings/SettingsRecycleBinPanel.tsx` — refactored into `RecycleBinTab` + `HistoryTab` sub-components under shared MUI Tabs switcher; History table: Type / Name / Action (colour-coded chip: red=deleted, green=restored, grey=purged) / Timestamp / Notes
- `ui/v2.5/src/locales/en-GB.json` — `recycle_bin.history.*` and `recycle_bin.column.*` locale keys

---

### fix: guard Begin() against nil readDB when database not initialised (8ff10ccc)

- `pkg/sqlite/transaction.go`: Add explicit nil check at the top of `Begin()` that returns `ErrDatabaseNotInitialized` instead of dereferencing nil when a migration is pending and `db.Open()` left `readDB`/`writeDB` as nil — converts the crash into a clean GraphQL error while the client is redirected to `/migrate`

---

### feat: use intPtr helper for PrimaryTagID in valid and invalid markers (7bfc63c9)

- Refactors marker test helpers to use `intPtr` for `PrimaryTagID` field assignments following the nullable migration

 GraphQL code generation complete (make generate)
 All changes preserve Vexxx customizations (MUI v7, segments, concurrent tasks)

### Next Steps
1. Complete PR #6514 resolver mutations and validation
2. Phase 2 remaining: 8 backend PRs
3. Phase 3-5: Major features, performance, UI enhancements

### Complete PR #6514: Auto-remove duplicate aliases (backend) (89860ee)

Applied UniqueExcludeFold to alias handling in all entity mutations:

### Performers (resolver_mutation_performer.go)
- PerformerCreate: Remove duplicate aliases and those matching name
- PerformerUpdate: Sanitize aliases when name changes
- BulkPerformerUpdate: Sanitize aliases when name changes

### Studios (resolver_mutation_studio.go)

### Implementation Details
- All mutations trim whitespace before deduplication
- Case-insensitive comparison using UniqueExcludeFold utility
- Update operations check if both name and aliases are being modified
- Aliases matching the new name are automatically excluded
- Existing validation logic remains unchanged

### Testing
 Full Go compilation successful (go build ./...)

This allows users to generate metadata (thumbnails, phashes) for all
images in selected galleries directly from the gallery list or detail page.

### Add upstream integration progress documentation (8756937)

Comprehensive tracking document for Phase 1 and Phase 2 progress:
- Phase 1: All 8 bug fixes complete (7 pre-existing, 1 applied)
- Phase 2: 5/12 PRs complete (6401, 6403, 6402, 6514, 6442)
- Detailed implementation notes and commit references
- Next session starting point and commands
- Build verification status and preserved Vexxx features

### Complete PR #6437: Add Interfaces to Destroy File Database Entries (6818e93)

Added ability to destroy file database entries without deleting filesystem files:

GraphQL Schema Changes:
- Added destroyFiles mutation to delete file entries from database
- Added destroy_file_entry field to GalleryDestroyInput
- Added destroy_file_entry field to ImageDestroyInput and ImagesDestroyInput
- Added destroy_file_entry field to SceneDestroyInput and ScenesDestroyInput

Go Model Changes:
- Updated all destroy input structs with DestroyFileEntry field

Service Interface Updates:
- Updated SceneService.Destroy signature
- Updated ImageService.Destroy signature
- Updated GalleryService.Destroy signature

Resolver Changes:
- Added DestroyFiles mutation resolver
- Updated GalleryDestroy to pass destroyFileEntry parameter
- Updated ImageDestroy and ImagesDestroy resolvers
- Updated SceneDestroy and ScenesDestroy resolvers
- Updated task_clean.go destroy calls with const parameters

Service Implementation:
- Added destroyFileEntries functions to scene, image, gallery services
- Updated all Destroy method signatures to accept destroyFileEntry parameter
- Added logic to destroy database entries while preserving filesystem files
- Updated merge.go to pass destroyFileEntry=false

This feature is useful for removing orphaned database entries when files
should be preserved on disk, such as when reorganizing libraries or fixing
database inconsistencies.

### Complete PR #6542: Bugfix - Scene Cover Merge Removing Covers (d1df5bc)

Fixed bug where merging scenes would remove existing cover images when
no new cover image was provided. Added check to only update cover image
if coverImageData is not empty.

Changes:
- Updated SceneMerge resolver to conditionally update cover image
- Prevents accidental removal of existing covers during merge operations

This ensures cover images are preserved during scene merges unless explicitly
replaced with new cover data.

### Update upstream integration docs: Phase 2 progress (8/12 complete) (fed38b4)

- Added PR #6437 (Destroy file DB entries - 18 files)
- Added PR #6542 (Cover merge bugfix - 1 file)
- Documented PRs already present: #6433, #6448, #6443, #6447
- Updated session history and next steps
- Phase 2: 5 implemented, 3 already present, 1 deferred (#6156)

### Refactor file scanning and handling logic (6c19203)

- Moved directory walking and queuing functionality into scan task code

### Refactor file scanning and handling logic (7eb5d22)

- Moved directory walking and queuing functionality into scan task code

### Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/Serechops/vexxx-stash (a1dd3a2)

### Refactor file scanning and handling logic (baf3c55)

- Moved directory walking and queuing functionality into scan task code

### Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/Serechops/vexxx-stash (e6724ea)

### Add synchronous scanFile GraphQL mutation (e031466)

Implements a synchronous single-file scan mutation that returns results
immediately, in contrast to the existing async metadataScan operation.

Changes:
- Add ScanFileInput, ScanFileStatus, and ScanFileResult GraphQL types
- Add scanFile mutation to GraphQL schema
- Implement Manager.ScanFile() using refactored Scanner.ScanFile() method
- Add scanFile resolver with proper type conversion
- Generate updated GraphQL code

Benefits:
- Enables on-demand scanning of individual files without job queue overhead
- Returns immediate feedback with status (NEW/UPDATED/RENAMED/UNCHANGED/SKIPPED)
- Useful for integrations that need to programmatically trigger and verify scans
- Supports selective rescanning via rescan flag
- Complements the upstream Scanner refactor (prep work from PR #6498)

The synchronous approach is ideal for API clients that need to scan a single
file and immediately receive the result, such as file watcher integrations,
manual file addition workflows, or testing scenarios.

### fix(ui): resolve modal backdrop and menu interaction issues (e4f76e2)

Fixed dark backdrop overlays and click-outside behavior for all Menu and
Popover components throughout the application. Users can now interact with
page content while menus are open, and menus properly close when clicking
outside.

Changes:
- Added hideBackdrop prop to all Menu/Popover components to remove dark overlay
- Implemented pointer-events passthrough for operation menus that should allow
  page interaction while open (Scene, Image, Gallery, Performer operations)
- Added manual click-away detection via useEffect for menus using pointer-events
- Removed ellipsis from "Generate" menu item labels for cleaner UI

Components updated:
* Operations menus: Scene.tsx, Image.tsx, Gallery.tsx
* Shared components: ScraperMenu.tsx, ImageInput.tsx, HoverPopover.tsx,
  ExternalLinksButton.tsx
* List components: ListOperationButtons.tsx, Pagination.tsx, ListViewOptions.tsx,
  PlaylistList.tsx
* Scene components: SceneHistoryPanel.tsx, OCounterButton.tsx, SceneTagger.tsx
* Other: PerformerEditPanel.tsx, ParserInput.tsx, StashConfiguration.tsx
* Lists: SceneList.tsx, ImageList.tsx, GalleryList.tsx

fix(api): allow clearing scene cover images

Updated sceneUpdateCoverImage to properly handle empty cover image data,
allowing users to clear/remove cover images. This brings the fork in sync
with upstream fix while preserving Vexxx-specific features (virtual scenes,
auto-rename, gallery generation).

### Fix: Support local image URLs when authentication is enabled (#5538) (e5da35a)

Resolves stashapp/stash#5538

When setting a performer/studio/tag/scene image via a local Stash URL
(e.g., http://localhost:9999/performer/123/image), the backend would
make an unauthenticated HTTP request to itself. This fails with a 401
error when authentication is enabled, resulting in malformed images.

Changes:

Frontend (ImageInput.tsx):
- Detect same-origin image URLs and fetch them client-side using the
  browser's authenticated session (browser has cookies)
- Convert fetched image to base64 data URI before sending to backend
- Avoids backend self-requests entirely for all UI users

Backend (local_image.go + mutation resolvers):
- Add processLocalOrRemoteImage() method to Resolver
- Intercept relative paths (e.g., /performer/123/image) and read image
  data directly from database via GetImage() calls
- Bypasses HTTP layer completely for local resources
- Updated all 21 ProcessImageInput call sites across 7 mutation files

Supported local path patterns:
- /performer/{id}/image
- /studio/{id}/image
- /tag/{id}/image
- /scene/{id}/screenshot
- /group/{id}/frontimage
- /group/{id}/backimage

Benefits:
- Fixes image setting for all entity types when auth is enabled
- Works for both UI users and plugins/GraphQL API consumers
- No security concerns (no API key attachment, no auth bypass)
- Performance improvement (DB read vs HTTP roundtrip)
- Clean architecture (path-based routing in backend)

### Add duplicate title filter for galleries (#6516) (f494e6b)

Implements a new GraphQL filter to identify galleries with duplicate titles,
enabling users to find and manage galleries that share the same name.

Changes:
- Added title_duplicated boolean field to GalleryFilterType in GraphQL schema
- Implemented titleDuplicatedCriterionHandler in gallery SQL filters
- Filter uses SQL GROUP BY with HAVING COUNT to detect duplicates efficiently
- Supports both positive (show duplicates) and negative (show unique) filtering

Benefits:
- Enables deduplication workflows for gallery management
- Allows users to identify galleries that may need renaming or merging
- Provides efficient SQL-based duplicate detection without application-level processing
- Follows existing filter patterns for consistency with scene duplicate detection
- Empty and NULL titles are excluded from duplicate matching

The filter can be used via GraphQL queries:
  findGalleries(filter: { title_duplicated: true })   # Only duplicates
  findGalleries(filter: { title_duplicated: false })  # Only unique titles

### Optimize gallery zip scanning to skip contents when hash unchanged (#6512) (6adf976)

Implements performance optimization for gallery scanning by only iterating
through zip file contents when the container's hash has actually changed,
rather than whenever the file is rescanned or metadata-only changes occur.

Changes:
- Added HashChanged field to ScanFileResult in pkg/file/scan.go
- Modified onExistingFile() to track fingerprint changes separately from file updates
- Updated handleFile() in task_scan.go to check HashChanged instead of Updated for zips
- Uses Fingerprints.ContentsChanged() to detect actual hash changes vs metadata updates

Benefits:
- Dramatically reduces scan time for users with large gallery collections
- Avoids expensive iteration through thousands of images when only file metadata changed
- Still validates zip file integrity by recalculating the container hash
- Preserves existing behavior for new galleries (full scan on first detection)
- Maintains data accuracy - only skips iteration when hash confirms no content changes
- Particularly beneficial during forced rescans where previously all zip contents were re-processed

Technical Details:
The optimization distinguishes between:
- File metadata changes (modtime, permissions) → Skip zip iteration
- File content changes (hash differs) → Full zip iteration required
- New files → Full zip iteration required

When a zip file's modification time changes but its MD5/oshash remains the same,
the gallery record is updated but individual image files inside are not re-scanned.
This is safe because the zip's hash would change if any internal content was modified.

### Add duplicate title filter for galleries (#6516) (f5b7b7d)

Implements a complete frontend and backend solution for filtering galleries by
duplicate titles, enabling users to identify and manage galleries that share
the same name.

Backend Changes:
- Added title_duplicated boolean field to GalleryFilterType in GraphQL schema
- Implemented titleDuplicatedCriterionHandler in gallery SQL filters
- Filter uses SQL GROUP BY with HAVING COUNT to detect duplicates efficiently
- Supports both positive (show duplicates) and negative (show unique) filtering

Frontend Changes:
- Added "Duplicated Title" filter option to gallery list filters
- Integrated with Gallery filter UI using BooleanCriterionOption
- Added locale string for filter label in en-GB.json

Benefits:
- Enables deduplication workflows for gallery management
- Users can identify galleries that may need renaming or merging
- Efficient SQL-based duplicate detection without application-level processing
- Follows existing filter patterns for consistency with scene duplicate detection
- Empty and NULL titles are excluded from duplicate matching
- Seamless integration with existing filter UI and functionality

The filter can be used in the UI via the Galleries page filter panel, or
programmatically via GraphQL:
  findGalleries(filter: { title_duplicated: true })   # Only duplicates
  findGalleries(filter: { title_duplicated: false })  # Only unique titles

### fix: restore settings access when auth is disabled after user creation (1b0d0dc)

When an admin user removes all credentials and API keys, the system
should revert to "no authentication required" mode. However, this
created a dead state where /settings became permanently inaccessible:

- Admin cannot self-delete (protected by UserDestroy mutation)
- userCount remains > 0 (admin still exists in database)
- currentUser returns null (no auth session)
- isSetupMode = false (users exist)
- isAdmin = false (no authenticated user)
- Result: /settings route blocked by ProtectedRoute

The fix introduces "no-auth mode" detection in UserContext. When
the currentUser query succeeds without error but returns null, and
users exist in the database, the system recognizes that authentication
is not configured and grants full admin permissions.

This is distinguished from "user not logged in" (which returns 401
error) by checking that the query succeeded (!userError) while
returning null.

Benefits:
- Restores /settings access when switching from multi-user back to
  single-user mode
- Maintains backward compatibility with no-auth installations
- Preserves security: requires actual login when auth IS configured
  (401 errors correctly restrict access)
- Enables admins to manage users and re-enable auth after clearing
  credentials

Updated tests to verify both setup mode (userCount=0) and no-auth
mode (userCount>0, no current user, no error) grant admin access.

### Optimize SQLite path filtering for large databases (a530083)

Implements four complementary optimizations to address performance issues
with path-based filtering on large media collections (GitHub issue #6455):

A. Decomposed Path Search Strategy
   - Rewrote getPathSearchClause() to avoid per-row string concatenation
   - Exact matches: use concatenation (necessary for full path equality)
   - Patterns with separators: search folders.path directly
   - Patterns without separators: OR-based search on path and basename

B. Prefix-Matchable Pattern Detection
   - Added isAbsolutePath() to detect Unix/Windows absolute paths
   - Added containsPathSeparator() to identify folder-level patterns
   - Absolute paths now use prefix matching (no leading wildcard)
   - Enables SQLite B-tree index usage on folders.path

C. INNER JOIN for Path Filter Criteria
   - Added addFoldersTableInner() to scene/image/gallery repositories
   - Path filters now use INNER JOINs instead of LEFT JOINs
   - Allows query planner to reorder joins and start from indexed folders table
   - Original LEFT JOIN methods preserved for non-path contexts

D. Write-Side Whitespace Trimming
   - Added zeroStringFromTrimmed() helper in record.go
   - Updated setString()/setNullString() to trim on write
   - Updated all entity from<Type> methods (scene, gallery, image, performer,
     studio, tag, group) to use trimmed helper
   - Whitespace-only strings now stored as NULL, eliminating need for
     query-time TRIM() in IS NULL/NOT NULL checks

Benefits:
- Eliminates per-row string concatenation overhead (millions of rows affected)
- Enables index usage for absolute path prefix searches
- Allows query planner flexibility to start from indexed folders table
- Removes query-time TRIM() overhead for NULL checks
- Maintains backward compatibility (query behavior unchanged)
- No migration required (existing data works as-is, trimmed on next update)

Testing:
- Added 20 new unit tests covering all helper functions
- All existing 57 sqlite unit tests pass
- Full project compiles cleanly with no regressions

Technical Notes:
- filterBuilder's joins.addUnique() won't upgrade LEFT→INNER for same alias,
  so separate addFoldersTableInner() methods ensure INNER JOINs when needed
- Write-side trimming is forward-compatible: future migration could remove
  TRIM() from IS NULL checks once all data normalized
- Path separator detection handles both Unix (/) and Windows (\) paths

Files Modified:
- pkg/sqlite/criterion_handlers.go (path search decomposition + helpers)
- pkg/sqlite/scene_filter.go, image_filter.go, gallery_filter.go (INNER JOIN)
- pkg/sqlite/scene.go, image.go, gallery.go (INNER JOIN methods)
- pkg/sqlite/record.go (write-side trimming helpers)
- pkg/sqlite/performer.go, studio.go, tag.go, group.go (trimmed writes)
- pkg/sqlite/group_relationships.go (trimmed writes)
- pkg/sqlite/filter_internal_test.go (new tests)

### feat: Integrate gallery list sidebar and add GalleriesHero component (71aca77)

Integrates the gallery list sidebar interface from upstream Stash commit
b5de30a, providing a consistent collapsible sidebar UI across all main
entity lists (Studios, Performers, and Galleries). Also adds a new
GalleriesHero component for visual appeal on the main galleries page.

Gallery List Sidebar Changes:
- Refactored GalleryList.tsx to use FilteredGalleryList with
  useFilteredItemList hook instead of ItemList pattern
- Added 5 sidebar filter sections: Studios, Performers, Tags, Rating,
  and Organized (boolean)
- Fixed SidebarPerformersFilter and SidebarStudiosFilter to include all
  required props (option, title, data-type, sectionID)
- Added missing criterion option imports (PerformersCriterionOption,
  StudiosCriterionOption)
- Updated Galleries.tsx to use FilteredGalleryList export
- Updated 3 gallery panel components: PerformerGalleriesPanel,
  StudioGalleriesPanel, and TagGalleriesPanel
- Preserved all 3 display modes: Grid, List, and Wall
- Adapted react-bootstrap components to Material UI (Button)
- Fixed import path for GalleryCardGrid (from GalleryGridCard.tsx)
- Added conditional Box wrapper for hero positioning (65vh margin with
  gradient blend on main Galleries page)

GalleriesHero Component:
- Created new GalleriesHero.tsx with 3D carousel of random galleries
- Displays 25 random gallery covers with auto-advance (3s intervals)
- Interactive click-to-navigate on active gallery
- Shows title and image count overlay on active item
- Matches ImagesHero dimensions and styling (h-[100%], top-[-1%])
- Uses gallery.paths.cover for cover image access
- Responsive design (hidden on mobile, visible on desktop)

The gallery list now provides the same modern filtering experience as
the studio and performer lists, with dedicated sidebar sections for each
filter type, a streamlined toolbar interface, and an elegant hero banner
for visual engagement.

### chore: Remove unused TagList_OLD.tsx backup file (c18dc6c)

### FR: Add Generate Task to Galleries (#6442) (402fdfb)

### fix: Remove duplicate GalleryIDs section in task_generate.go (e1cc8f9)

The cherry-pick introduced duplicate code for handling gallery image generation.
Removed the duplicate section that had incorrect queueImageJob call signature.

### fix: Repair broken GalleryList and Gallery components after merge conflicts (686aabe)

GalleryList.tsx was completely broken due to corrupted merge combining old ItemList
pattern with new sidebar pattern. Rewrote entire file based on PerformerList.tsx
template to properly implement the modern useFilteredItemList pattern.

GalleryList.tsx fixes:
- Removed all duplicate code (old ItemListContext JSX, duplicate functions)
- Added ~30 missing imports (PatchContainerComponent, useFocus, useSidebarState,
  all sidebar filter components, criterion options, utility hooks, etc.)
- Removed duplicate modal/showModal/closeModal declarations
- Fixed JSX structure with proper div wrapper and Box hero wrapper
- Removed unsupported props from GalleryWallCard (selected/onSelectedChanged/selecting)
- Removed onInvertSelection (not available from useListSelect hook)
- Removed invert selection operation from toolbar menu

Gallery.tsx fixes:
- Removed duplicate GenerateDialog import and declaration
- Fixed 3 Dropdown.Item  MenuItem tag mismatches
- Fixed 3 div  Box opening tag mismatches
- Added missing collapsed state variable declaration

GalleryCard.tsx enhancement:
- Made selection checkbox visible on hover for better UX
- Added click handler to checkbox that prevents link navigation

Benefits:
- Galleries list now renders properly with full sidebar filter support
- Consistent UI architecture across all list components (Scenes/Performers/Tags/Galleries)
- Selection mode works correctly with hover-to-select functionality
- Build succeeds with zero TypeScript errors
- Clean separation of concerns between display components and list management

### fix: Prevent lightbox navigation arrows from sliding down on hover (4d46304)

Navigation arrows were sliding to the bottom of the screen when hovered,
making them unclickable and breaking the lightbox navigation experience.

Root causes:
1. Transform conflict - Used 'top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%)' for
   vertical centering, but MUI IconButton applies its own transform during
   hover/ripple states, overriding translateY(-50%) and causing buttons to
   snap to 'top: 50%' then slide further down
2. Transition: all - SVG transition included all properties, potentially
   animating layout-affecting changes during hover state
3. Class conflict - Bootstrap 'd-lg-block' sets 'display: block !important'
   which conflicts with MUI's inline-flex and flex-based centering

Solutions:
- Replaced transform centering with flex-based centering (top: 0; bottom: 0;
  display: flex; align-items: center) - immune to MUI transform interference
- Changed SVG transition from 'all' to explicit 'opacity, color' properties
- Replaced Bootstrap visibility classes with Tailwind 'hidden lg:flex' for
  consistency and to avoid display property conflicts
- Increased z-index from 1045 to 2001 to ensure arrows render above header/
  footer controls (z-index 2000)
- Added padding to button containers for better hover target area

Benefits:
- Navigation arrows stay fixed in position when hovered
- Smooth hover transitions without layout shifts
- Improved clickability and user experience in lightbox
- Consistent behavior across different screen sizes
- No conflicts between CSS frameworks (Bootstrap/MUI/Tailwind)

### refactor: Mirror ImageDetailPanel layout for Gallery page (b31803d)

Completely restructured Gallery page to match the clean, responsive layout
from the Image detail page. This provides consistent UX across detail views
and resolves layout issues with tabs running across the page.

Layout changes:
- Replaced Bootstrap row/col classes with MUI Box flex layout
- Left panel (details/tabs): Fixed 450px width on desktop, stacked on mobile
- Right panel (images/add): Fluid width, takes remaining space
- Responsive ordering: Images first on mobile, details first on desktop
- Both panels constrained to viewport height with independent scrolling

Gallery details (left panel):
- Studio logo and title in flexbox layout with responsive sizing
- Toolbar with rating, organized button, and operations menu
- Sticky tabs that stay at top when scrolling content
- Tab panels: Details, Scenes, File Info, Chapters, Edit

Gallery content (right panel):
- Sticky tabs for Images/Add at top of container
- GalleryImagesPanel or GalleryAddPanel content below
- Independent scrolling from details panel

Styling improvements:
- MUI sx prop for all responsive styles (replaces inline classes)
- Typography uses responsive font sizes (xs: 1.5rem, xl: 1.75rem)
- Proper spacing and padding (15px, consistent with Image page)
- Toolbar items use columnGap for consistent spacing
- Rating component no longer stretches panel width

Removed:
- Bootstrap .row/.col/.details-tab/.content-container classes
- Old .gallery-page/.gallery-tabs/.gallery-container classes
- Unused 'collapsed' state variable
- Custom .gallery-sticky-tabs class (replaced by MUI sticky Box)

Benefits:
- Consistent layout and UX across Image and Gallery detail pages
- Proper responsive behavior on mobile/tablet/desktop
- Rating gauge no longer stretches the panel
- Both panels scroll independently - better for long content
- Cleaner code with MUI sx styling instead of mixed CSS classes
- Fixed issue where tabs would rearrange the entire page

### fix: Add missing FilterMode cases and criterion options for cross-entity filtering (89805f5)

LabeledIdFilter: Add FilterMode.Studios and FilterMode.Tags support
- Added TagFilterType import to LabeledIdFilter.tsx
- Extended IFilterType interface with tags_filter/tag_count and studios_filter/studio_count
- Added FilterMode.Studios case to setObjectFilter (sets studios_filter)
- Added FilterMode.Tags case to setObjectFilter (sets tags_filter)
- Changed default case from throwing error to silent skip for unsupported modes
- Fixes 'Invalid filter mode' errors when using SidebarTagsFilter on Studios page
  or SidebarPerformersFilter on Tags page

Tags filter model: Add PerformersCriterionOption to criterion options
- Imported PerformersCriterionOption in tags.ts
- Added to TagListFilterOptions criterionOptions array
- Fixes 'Unknown criterion parameter name: performers' error on Tags page
- Enables SidebarPerformersFilter to track UI state for performer selection

TagList UI: Remove unsupported SidebarRatingFilter
- Tags don't have rating100 field in GraphQL schema (TagFilterType)
- Removed SidebarRatingFilter component and unused imports
- Prevents potential crash when rating filter would be opened

Scene page layout: Fix viewport filling with dynamic height
- Added explicit sx props to scene-layout Box for proper flexbox layout
- Height: calc(100vh - 3.5rem) accounts for navbar + .main padding
- Ensures scene-layout MuiBox dynamically fills main container
- Works in harmony with existing Scenes/styles.scss rules

Benefits:
- Cross-entity filtering now works correctly across all entity pages
- Studios page can filter by tags (SidebarTagsFilter)
- Tags page can filter by performers (SidebarPerformersFilter)
- Scene detail pages properly fill viewport without extra scroll space
- Consistent sidebar filter behavior across all list pages
- Graceful handling of unsupported filter modes instead of crashes

- Changed StudioList to use SmartStudioCardGrid instead of StudioCardGrid
- Aligns studio list behavior with tag list implementation
- SmartStudioCardGrid includes virtualization support and proper zoom handling
- Fixes issue where studio grid cards weren't resizing based on zoom level

The studio card grid now correctly displays:
- Zoom 4: 3 cards wide
- Zoom 3: 4 cards wide
- Zoom 2: 5 cards wide
- Zoom 1 (default): 7 cards wide
- Zoom 0: 8 cards wide

### feat(ui): Major improvements to hero banners, zoom controls, and layouts (6a70d31)

Studio Cards & Zoom:
- Updated StudioList to use SmartStudioCardGrid for proper zoom handling
- Aligns studio grid behavior with tag grid implementation
- Studio cards now correctly resize at all zoom levels (3-8 cards wide)

Hero Banner Redesign:

- Reduced top margin from 50vw/4 spacing units to 2 (16px)
- Hero banners remain hidden on mobile (md: breakpoint)

Component Fixes:
- Added maxWidth constraints to RatingBar (200px compact, 300px normal)
- Prevents rating bar from stretching across entire page width

All designs feature premium aesthetics, layered depth with gradients,
smooth professional animations, and better content hierarchy.

### fix(ui): Selective Scan now shows all configured libraries at root (ca6d799)

Fixed navigation bug where "Selective Scan" dialog would immediately drill
into the first library's subdirectories instead of showing all configured
library paths for selection.

Changes:
- DirectorySelectionDialog: Initialize currentDirectory to empty string to
  start at root level showing all libraries
- FolderSelect: Added isAtRoot detection to override backend's home directory
  result with the configured library paths (defaultDirectories) when at root

Previously, the dialog would start at libraryPaths?.[0], and the backend's
getDir("") returns the home directory, so the library list was never shown.
Now users can browse the full list of configured libraries and navigate into
any of them.

### chore: removing unnecessary build artifacts from project root. (c434c63)

### refactor(ui): Migrate Tagger component from SCSS to MUI sx props (b4cc865)

- Preserve minimal classNames as CSS hooks where needed (IncludeButton)

Component improvements:
- Constrain scene preview to max-width: 240px to prevent oversized rows
- Refactor performer thumbnails from stacked Grid rows to horizontal wrap
  with compact 32px circular images
- Add playOnHover prop to ScenePreview for hover-based video playback

### ui: overhaul markers tab into structured list view (dee1596c)

- Replace marker cards with a chronologically sorted MUI Table
- Implement fixed-width columns for Time and Primary Tag to ensure alignment
- Add line-clamping (2 lines max) and word-break logic to handle long titles
- Cap the displayed tags to 2 per marker with a "+X" overflow indicator
- Add section headers for "Markers" and "Marker Previews" for better hierarchy

### feat(gen): parallelize phash and sprite generation with concurrency limits (cbb646d7)

Optimizes video scanning and generation performance by parallelizing the extraction
of screenshots for phash and sprite sheets.

- Parallelized phash generation (25 frames) in `pkg/hash/videophash`
- Parallelized sprite generation (81 frames) in `internal/manager/generator_sprite.go`
  for both fast-seek and slow-seek code paths
- Added package-level semaphores in both packages capped at `runtime.NumCPU()` to
  bound the total number of concurrent FFmpeg processes
- Verified 2.0x–2.4x speedup on 720p content with zero phash divergence (identical
  results to the original sequential approach)

### feat(backend): add security, reliability & observability improvements (4856ade5)

- Sanitize internal errors (SQL, filesystem) in GraphQL responses to prevent leaking
  implementation details; add error codes to extensions for programmatic handling
- Add GraphQL query complexity limit (750) to prevent abuse from deeply nested
  recursive relation queries
- Add per-file panic recovery in scan job workers so a single corrupt file cannot
  crash the entire scan
- Pre-compile whitespace regex at package level to avoid repeated compilation in
  hot filter path
- Log slow queries (>100ms) as warnings with query name
- Add `/health` endpoint (version, status) and `/api/metrics` endpoint (DB, cache,
  job, API counters) to server routes

### feat(ui): implement playlist deletion with cache eviction (01a8169b)

- Added missing delete functionality to PlaylistList with a confirmation dialog
- Implemented Apollo Client cache eviction (`cache.evict`) for the `playlistDestroy`
  mutation in both PlaylistList and PlaylistDetails
- Fixed an issue where deleted playlists remained visible in the UI until a manual
  page refresh

### feat(interactive): migrate Handy integration to API v3, add controls overlay (b3665c52)

- Add `handy-api-v3.ts` — full TypeScript v3 REST client (HandyAPIv3 class) with
  HAMP, HSSP, HDSP, HVP, HSP, server-time sync, and emergency stop; replaces the
  `thehandy` npm package entirely
- Rewrite `interactive.ts` — IInteractiveClient implementation backed by HandyAPIv3;
  HSSP sync via setFunscriptUrl/play/stop; HAMP autopilot fallback when no funscript
  is present
- Extend `utils.ts` — IDeviceSettings gains `handyAppKey`; IInteractiveClient gains
  `setMode`, `hampStart/Stop`, `hvpStart/Stop/setHvpState`, `emergencyStop`
- Add `handyAppKey` to GraphQL config schema (backend + frontend fragment)
- Wire `handyAppKey` through `context.tsx` and `SettingsInterfacePanel.tsx` (new App
  Key input field alongside existing Connection Key)
- Add `InteractiveControls.tsx` — collapsible MUI overlay rendered inside ScenePlayer;
  emergency stop, HAMP toggle, mode indicator; visible when an interactive client is
  active
- Wire InteractiveControls into ScenePlayer.tsx
- Remove `thehandy` from package.json dependencies
- Add locale strings for `handy_app_key` and `handy_controls` to en-GB.json

### feat: add Auto-Identify after phash scan option (dae128d2)

Adds a new `scanAutoIdentify` boolean to `ScanMetadataOptions` that, when enabled
alongside `scanGeneratePhashes`, automatically runs the Identify process on a scene
immediately after its perceptual hash is generated during a scan.

- `internal/manager/config/tasks.go`: add `ScanAutoIdentify` field
- `graphql/schema/types/metadata.graphql`: expose `scanAutoIdentify` on both
  `ScanMetadataInput` and `ScanMetadataOptions`
- `internal/manager/task_identify.go`: add `autoIdentifyScene()` helper that runs a
  single-scene identify using the configured default Identify sources; no-ops when no
  sources are configured
- `internal/manager/task_scan.go`: call `autoIdentifyScene()` after phash generation
  when `ScanAutoIdentify` is set
- `ui/v2.5/src/locales/en-GB.json`: add locale keys for toggle and tooltip
- `ui/v2.5/src/components/Settings/Tasks/ScanOptions.tsx`: add sub-setting toggle
  nested under the phash option, disabled when phash generation is off

### feat: add stash-diag standalone diagnostic CLI tool (pending)

Introduces `cmd/stash-diag/` — a self-contained Go binary for offline diagnosis of
a Stash installation without needing a running server. Reads the same `config.yml`
as the main binary.

**Features:**
- 12 check categories: CONFIG, PATHS, FFMPEG, DATABASE, PLUGINS, SCRAPERS, NETWORK,
  PERMISSIONS, PYTHON, LOG, CONNECTIVITY, PROCESS
- Interactive TUI (bubbletea + bubbles/viewport) with spinner, bordered section panels,
  scrollable output, and summary footer
- `--json` flag for machine-readable output
- `--no-tui` flag for plain-text output (CI/logging)
- `--url` / `--api-key` flags to mirror live config from a running Stash instance via
  GraphQL (`configuration.general`)
- `--verbose` flag to surface full log tail and extended details

**Check highlights:**
- DATABASE: schema version vs expected, WAL journal mode, `PRAGMA integrity_check(1)`
  with 10s timeout
- PATHS: all work directories with free disk space; warns below 1 GiB
- NETWORK: listen address, TLS state, TCP port probe, per-platform firewall detection
  (PowerShell/netsh on Windows; ufw/nft/iptables/ss on Linux; socketfilterfw/pfctl
  on macOS)
- PERMISSIONS: write-probe on generated/cache/metadata/blobs/plugins/scrapers dirs;
  DB R/W open test; config file stat
- LOG: tail last 50 lines, surface up to 10 ERROR/FATAL lines
- CONNECTIVITY: HTTP HEAD to all stash-box endpoints, plugin and scraper package
  source URLs
- PROCESS: detect running Stash PID and listening address (tasklist+netstat on
  Windows; pgrep+ss on Unix)

**Files added:**
- `cmd/stash-diag/main.go` — entry point, flags, `runAllChecks()`, routing
- `cmd/stash-diag/checks.go` — checkPaths, checkFFmpeg, checkDatabase, checkPlugins,
  checkScrapers, checkOnline
- `cmd/stash-diag/checks_network.go` — checkNetwork, checkPermissions
- `cmd/stash-diag/checks_extra.go` — checkPython, checkLogFile, checkConfigPermissions,
  checkConnectivity, checkProcess
- `cmd/stash-diag/tui.go` — bubbletea TUI model
- `cmd/stash-diag/firewall_windows.go` / `firewall_linux.go` / `firewall_darwin.go` /
  `firewall_other.go` — per-platform firewall detection
- `cmd/stash-diag/disk_windows.go` / `disk_unix.go` — cross-platform free disk space
- `Makefile`: added `stash-diag` target
- `ui/v2.5/package.json`: added `build:diag` and `run:diag` scripts
